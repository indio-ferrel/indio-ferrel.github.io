#### VS Code
* Alt+Shift+Down copies line down
* Alt+Down moves line down
* Alt+Click puts cursor in multiple places to type in multiple places at once

JS convention is single quotes.  HTML is double.

#### bash
* `~` is home [^1] 
* `..` is cwd's[^2] parent folder (i.e. `cd ..` is "go up one")
* `-` is at least sometimes "previous cwd" (`cd -` is "back one")

[^1]: In Windows git bash with default settings, C:\Users\$username - But I think git bash's home is wherever .gitconfig is, so not necessarily 'real' home.
[^2]: 'cwd' often (in my experience doing very simple bash manually) equivalent to the output of `pwd`, but not literally the same.  (i.e. in git bash when I'm "in" /d/Alchemy and use 'pwd' alone, the output is `/d/Alchemy` which is also what I call cwd in that case)
